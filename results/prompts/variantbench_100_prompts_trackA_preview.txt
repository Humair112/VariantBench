You are an expert clinical variant curator applying the ACMG/AMP guidelines.
I will give you a single missense SNV with limited information:

• HGVS (protein-level): p.Gly475Ser
• Allele frequency (gnomAD popmax): 5.08e-06
• In-silico summary: CADD=3e+01; SIFT=D; PolyPhen=D; MetaLR=0.99(D); FATHMM=0.96(D); AlphaMissense=0.785

Scope: Evaluate ONLY these five ACMG criteria and ignore all others:
- PM2  (absent/ultra-rare in population databases)
- PP3  (multiple in-silico tools support a deleterious effect)
- PS1  (same amino-acid change as a known Pathogenic variant, but different DNA change)
- BS1  (allele frequency is too high for the disorder)
- BA1  (stand-alone benign frequency; very common)

Tasks:
1) Assign ONE final 5-tier ACMG label: "Pathogenic", "Likely Pathogenic", "VUS", "Likely Benign", or "Benign".
2) Decide TRUE/FALSE for PM2, PP3, PS1, BS1, BA1 using only the information above. Do not invent fields not shown.

Return ONLY a single JSON object with this exact schema and lowercase booleans:

{
  "label": "<one of: Pathogenic|Likely Pathogenic|VUS|Likely Benign|Benign>",
  "PM2": true/false,
  "PP3": true/false,

  "BS1": true/false,
  "BA1": true/false,

• In-silico summary: CADD=2e+01; SIFT=T; PolyPhen=P; MetaLR=0.87(D); FATHMM=0.14(N); AlphaMissense=0.0803

Scope: Evaluate ONLY these five ACMG criteria and ignore all others:
- PM2  (absent/ultra-rare in population databases)
- PP3  (multiple in-silico tools support a deleterious effect)

- BS1  (allele frequency is too high for the disorder)
- BA1  (stand-alone benign frequency; very common)

Tasks:
1) Assign ONE final 5-tier ACMG label: "Pathogenic", "Likely Pathogenic", "VUS", "Likely Benign", or "Benign".

• In-silico summary: CADD=4; SIFT=T; PolyPhen=B; MetaLR=0.0024(T); FATHMM=NA(NA); AlphaMissense=0.219

Scope: Evaluate ONLY these five ACMG criteria and ignore all others:
- PM2  (absent/ultra-rare in population databases)
- PP3  (multiple in-silico tools support a deleterious effect)
- PS1  (same amino-acid change as a known Pathogenic variant, but different DNA change)
- BS1  (allele frequency is too high for the disorder)
- BA1  (stand-alone benign frequency; very common)

Tasks:
1) Assign ONE final 5-tier ACMG label: "Pathogenic", "Likely Pathogenic", "VUS", "Likely Benign", or "Benign".
2) Decide TRUE/FALSE for PM2, PP3, PS1, BS1, BA1 using only the information above. Do not invent fields not shown.

Return ONLY a single JSON object with this exact schema and lowercase booleans:

{

I will give you a single missense SNV with limited information:

• HGVS (protein-level): p.Glu242Asp
• Allele frequency (gnomAD popmax): 0.000165
• In-silico summary: CADD=2e+01; SIFT=T; PolyPhen=B; MetaLR=0.24(T); FATHMM=0.47(N); AlphaMissense=0.0898

Scope: Evaluate ONLY these five ACMG criteria and ignore all others:
- PM2  (absent/ultra-rare in population databases)
- PP3  (multiple in-silico tools support a deleterious effect)
- PS1  (same amino-acid change as a known Pathogenic variant, but different DNA change)
- BS1  (allele frequency is too high for the disorder)
- BA1  (stand-alone benign frequency; very common)

Tasks:
1) Assign ONE final 5-tier ACMG label: "Pathogenic", "Likely Pathogenic", "VUS", "Likely Benign", or "Benign".
2) Decide TRUE/FALSE for PM2, PP3, PS1, BS1, BA1 using only the information above. Do not invent fields not shown.

Return ONLY a single JSON object with this exact schema and lowercase booleans:

1) Assign ONE final 5-tier ACMG label: "Pathogenic", "Likely Pathogenic", "VUS", "Likely Benign", or "Benign".
2) Decide TRUE/FALSE for PM2, PP3, PS1, BS1, BA1 using only the information above. Do not invent fields not shown.

Return ONLY a single JSON object with this exact schema and lowercase booleans:
