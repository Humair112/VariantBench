You are an expert clinical variant curator applying the ACMG/AMP guidelines.
I will give you a single missense SNV with limited information:

• HGVS (protein-level): p.Gly137Arg
• Allele frequency (gnomAD popmax): 8.47e-07
• In-silico summary: CADD=3e+01; SIFT=D; PolyPhen=D; MetaLR=0.41(T); FATHMM=0.95(D); AlphaMissense=1

Tasks:
1. Assign ONE final 5-tier ACMG label: "Pathogenic", "Likely Pathogenic", "VUS", "Likely Benign", or "Benign".
2. Decide TRUE/FALSE for the following ACMG criteria, using reasonable cutoffs:
   - PM2  (absent/ultra-rare in population databases)
   - PP3  (multiple in-silico tools support a deleterious effect)
   - PS1  (same amino-acid change as a known Pathogenic variant, but different DNA change)
   - BS1  (allele frequency is too high for the disorder)
   - BA1  (stand-alone benign frequency; very common)
3. Return ONLY a single JSON object with this exact schema and lowercase booleans:

{
  "label": "<one of: Pathogenic|Likely Pathogenic|VUS|Likely Benign|Benign>",
