"""
Light-weight ACMG/AMP combiner for 5 rules:
  BA1 (stand-alone benign),
  BS1 (strong benign),
  PS1 (strong pathogenic),
  PM2 (moderate pathogenic),
  PP3 (supporting pathogenic).

Order of precedence:
  1) Benign evidence first (BA1, BS1) â€“ frequency trumps.
  2) Then pathogenic patterns.  
  3) Otherwise VUS.

This mirrors a trimmed InterVar/ACMG table and prevents conflicts like
BS1=TRUE but calling Likely Pathogenic.
